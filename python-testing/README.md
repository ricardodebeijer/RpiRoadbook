# Testing out if python works
-  Open a terminal/console and type either `python`,`python3` or `python3.6` depending on what you have installed
- It should starting running Python and print the version. use `exit()` to close it again
- Most basic usage, cd into the python-testing folder and run `python hello.py` (or `python3.6 hello.py`)

# Setting up basic roadbook 
- If above worked, we can start on the basic roadbook app
- First install requirements from `requirements.txt`, by executing `python3.6 -m pip install --upgrade pygame`
- If its done installing, you can start running `python roadbook.py` (or `python3.6 roadbook.py`)
- ... TODO: rest of roadbook still needs to be implemented
